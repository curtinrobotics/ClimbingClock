# Climbing Clock Project

Welcome to the Climbing Clock project!

Here is where we store all our code and code backups.

## Getting Started

Please make sure you read the following to get a grasp on the project's code.

More importantly, remember to have fun!

## Project Details

**Organisation:** Curtin Robotics Club (CRoC)<br>
**Institute:** Curtin University (Bentley Campus)<br>
**Location:** Ground floor, building  204, Curtin University<br>
**Time:** Most Thursdays 6pm onwards (see CRoC personel for more details)<br>
**Project Lead:** Harrison G. Outram<br>
**Project Founder:** Ilke Dincer<br>
**Difficulty:** Easy to moderate (depends on exact task)

### Overall Project Goal

To make one or more robots climb in a manner that allows us to tell the time of day.

### Project Requirements

Project requirements are categorised into two types: functional requirements, and non-functional requirements (NFR). Functional requirements detail what the system has to do, whereas NFRs detail under what restrictions the system has to achieve its functional requirements. Please see the [project breakdown](https://github.com/curtinrobotics/ClimbingClock/blob/documentation/project_doc/(v0.1)%20Climbing%20Clock%20Project%20Breakdown.pdf) for a complete list of all functional and non-functional requirements.

## Progress Made

As evident by our latest versions and physical devices, we have made several strides into getting our project on track.

However, there is still much more to be done!

Please see our Kanban board or talk with us to get an idea of where you can fit in.

## Prerequisities

While everyone is welcome to join, CRoC has designed this project to be as first-year friendly as possible.
To promote and upload this standard, no experience nor knowledges are necessary to join!

To get you started, the project lead can update on where exactly the project is at. If the project lead is not available you can contact him/her through the club's Discord or on Facebook. If you need an answer immediately, please refer to the Kanban board, [project breakdown](https://github.com/curtinrobotics/ClimbingClock/blob/documentation/project_doc/(v0.1)%20Climbing%20Clock%20Project%20Breakdown.pdf), and other Climbing Clock members present.

Whether it be learning CAD software or using an Arduino for the first time, feel free to ask anyone anytime if you need help.

Don't worry if your first week or two seemed slow; even the project leads have spent entire build nights just researching how-to guides.

## Programming Standards

The Climbing Clock project demands a diverse team of programmers to tackle all nuances as they come.

Whether a novice or an advanced user, a standard must be established to keep the project on track. Please see the [project breakdown](https://github.com/curtinrobotics/ClimbingClock/blob/documentation/project_doc/(v0.1)%20Climbing%20Clock%20Project%20Breakdown.pdf) for a complete list of all programming standards. The project breakdown also includes examples of code that violates these rules as well as fixed examples.

If in doubt, ask a fellow Climbing Clock programmer or the project lead
