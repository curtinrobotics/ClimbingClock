# Simulation Files

## Purpose

This is where we store our files for collecting data for Simulink simulations.

## Standards

For each file, a comment block should be placed at the top specifying the following: -

1. The author(s)
2. The last updated date
3. The experiment number
4. The required hardware to perform the experiment

Please contact the project lead for clarification of any of the following.
